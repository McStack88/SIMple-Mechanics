# SIMple Mechanics
[![](https://gitlab.com/mkhan45/physics-v2/badges/master/pipeline.svg?key_text=build&style=flat-square)](https://gitlab.com/mkhan45/physics-v2/-/pipelines)

Educational physics sim that uses graphs, FBDs, and other helpful stuff to teach physics. 

SIMple Mechanics is part of my SIMple Physics project. Find more info at the website: [https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tabs/about](https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tabs/about/)

You can also find sample labs and tutorials at [https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tags/mechanics/](https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tags/mechanics/)

## Features

- [X] Basic physics simulation using [nphysics](nphysics.org)
- [X] Basic Lua scripting for saving presets
- [X] Create shapes
- [X] View and modify shape properties such as velocity through a GUI
- [X] Graph object properties
- [X] Export graphs to CSV

#### In a future release:
- [ ] Free body diagrams

- [ ] Ropes
- [ ] Lines

## Controls
- Left click to drag a shape
- Right click to view editable properties of a shape
- B to create a box, C to create a circle
- Space to pause/unpause
- S to toggle create shapes in static mode
- A to create new shapes from the center instead of bounds
- Shift+D to cler the scene
- D to delete object on sidepanel
- Use the top bar GUI to 
  - Create shapes
  - Edit global variables
  - Clear the scene
  - Pause

### Tech details

SIMple Mechanics is written in Rust using the `ggez` game engine, `npysics` physics engine, `specs` ECS, and `imgui-rs` GUI. I also used @iolivia's [`imgui-ggez-starter`](https://github.com/iolivia/imgui-ggez-starter).
